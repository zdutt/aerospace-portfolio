  bio: `Aerospace Engineering student at UCF focused on additive manufacturing, FEA, and process optimization. 
I’ve interned in additive at SIG SAUER (Summer 2024) and previously at Pirouette Medical (2023). 
My work spans EOS DMLS (IN625), post-processing workflows, CNC/G-code, and CAD across SOLIDWORKS (CSWA), CATIA, Fusion 360, Onshape, and Inventor. 
I contribute to Baja SAE and enjoy hands-on engineering with an emphasis on reliability, quality, and throughput.`,
